Authorization is a way that allows you to add authentication headers to the request.
Currently, supports `Bearer` and `Basic` authorization.

### Bearer

The bearer authorization is used to add a bearer token to the request. The token is added to the `Authorization` header.

```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    auth: {
        type: "Bearer",
        token: "my-token",
    },
})
```

### Basic

The basic authorization is used to add a basic authentication to the request. The username and password are added to the `Authorization` header.

```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    auth: {
        type: "Basic",
        username: "my-username",
        password: "my-password",
    },
})
```
